# Welcome to the BananaTok README!

This README will outline the features, intent, and technology of BananaTok.

# What is BananaTok?

[BananaTok](https://bananatok.herokuapp.com/) is a student project clone of the popular video social networking app: TikTok. It is not meant to be monetized and was purely designed as a demonstration of aptitude with the utilized technology stack. I chose to make a clone of TikTok because I found it to be a visually appealing app with commonly found social networking application features that I wanted to learn more about building (and breaking) from scratch. All in all I've had a great experience building this site and am proud of the work that I put into it.
